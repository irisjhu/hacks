## Do this first

In both `client` and `server` directories:

`npm install`

Get the .env file from Iris or make your own using your database access credentials.

## How to run client

`cd client`

`npm start`

This should run on port 3000 by default.

## How to run server

`cd server`

`npm start`

This should run on port 5000.

Visit `localhost:5000/example` to see if it works.
